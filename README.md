# replace-this-with-the-name-of-the-extension README

This is a template for helping others create a vscode theme. It has all the files needed + github actions for publishing it.

You will have to edit the following files:

-   `package.json` - replace the marked key values
-   `themes/theme.json` - replace the marked key values

Also, be sure to add a secret called `VSCE_PAT` in your github repository.

**Enjoy!**
